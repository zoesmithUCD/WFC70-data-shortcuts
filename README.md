### Additional Computer Shortcuts
#### (If you want to be fancy) 

-   Ctrl+Z: undo

-   Ctrl+Y: redo

    -   Note: in RStudio, the default shortcut for redo is Ctrl+Shift+Z, not Ctrl+Y, because Ctrl+Y is assigned to a different command. You can change this (and other shortcuts) by navigating to Tools → Modify keyboard shortcuts… → search “Paste Last Yank” → disable it (i.e. click in the “Shortcut” section and delete the existing shortcut), or following the steps from the R team [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE)
